# USE https://gitlab.com/tenten8401/Pterodactyl-Installer INSTEAD
An installer for Pterodactyl game server management panel (https://pterodactyl.io).  
This was intended for a fresh install of Ubuntu 16.04 Server, and may support CentOS in the future.
If you do not use a fresh install, things may be broken, and problems may arise.

# Running the script
Make sure to set up a MySQL database of some sort before beginning the installation. You can do so with the tutorial located [here](https://docs.pterodactyl.io/docs/setting-up-mysql).

Once you have set up a database, you can start the installation with the following command:  
```curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tenten8401/Pterodactyl-Installer/master/install.sh" | sudo bash```
